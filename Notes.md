Please note that certain functions of the Script like Remove Amibent sounds only works if you source the files from a release candidate. This is due to that the replacement files are file size 0 files. Thats how the removal works.

On a second note theres a list of folders the script expects to exist. If memory serves rigth they will be created if they dont exist.
Application Directory, Backup Dir
The configs dir comes with the Releases in its complete form. In source only broken versions exist. Migth be fixed at a later date.
